🕶️ SHADOWBREAKER

    “We are the ones they don’t see coming.”

Welcome to ShadowBreaker, a multi-hash cracking engine forged in the dark, built not for fame — but for precision.
We’re not script kiddies. We’re not pentesters.
We are vigilantes — and this is our blade.


⚔️ What It Does

    Cracks common hashes: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512

    Auto-detects hash type

    Supports any wordlist — local or custom

    Logs successful cracks to results.txt

    Lightweight. Offline. Ruthless.



🔍 Why ShadowBreaker?

Because sometimes the best defense... is a custom offense.
This isn’t another lazy wrapper. This is a hand-crafted breach engine — built by K1LLBYTE for real red team ops.
